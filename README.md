# PictionnaryGame
Pictionnary game made in the context of my studies.

Through the use of python and the library pyqt, I created a drawing game with the implementation of points, player turns, and an easy of use UI to make the experience as smooth as possible.

A summary of the project has been done in the word format, in the file "BSC-HGP - Assignment 02 - UI Design Document"
